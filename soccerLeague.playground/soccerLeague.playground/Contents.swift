 Project Desctiption: "You have volunteered to be the coordinator for your town’s youth soccer league. As part of your job you need to divide the 18 children who have signed up for the league into three even teams — Dragons, Sharks, and Raptors. In years past, the teams have been unevenly matched, so this year you are doing your best to fix that." - treehouse. Sort into 3 teams that are equal in experience then print letters for each player.
